## What?

A forum for discussions and in-person gatherings of like minded individuals in the Sea-To-Sky / Squamish area. Birds of a feather, if you will, interested in all things tech.

## When?

We aim to meet monthly and propose to follow the rough schedule below:
* One month we host a talk followed by networking and social discourse
* One month we host lightning talks followed by social discourse 
* One month we host a social event for freeform discussions and getting to know one another.

## Where?

Squamish, British Columbia, Canada. 

We meet at various local venues in Squamish be they co-working spaces, local companies that volunteer their space or local establishments that can cater to social gatherings.

Cheers!
